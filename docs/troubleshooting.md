# Troubleshooting

## Debug logging

To enable debug logging for a specific integration, follow these steps:

* Go to Settings > Devices & services.
* Select the integration card to open the detail page of the integration for which you want to enable debug logging.
* On the left side of the integration detail page, select Enable Debug Logging.

<details><summary>If you prefer, you can configure debugging through the `configuration.yaml` file</summary>

To enable debug for Proxmox VE integration, add following to your `configuration.yaml`:
```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.proxmoxve: debug
```
</details>

## Diagnostics

The integration supports Home Assistant's standard diagnostics download (Settings > Devices & services > Proxmox VE > ⋮ > Download diagnostics), useful for attaching to bug reports. It includes the config entry's settings (credentials redacted) and a snapshot of the last data polled by every active coordinator (nodes, VMs/CTs, storage, disks, ZFS, tasks, updates, and — if configured — the HA-managed resource list and cluster HA status). Node, VM/CT, and storage names are not redacted since they're the point of a diagnostics dump; review the file before sharing it publicly if that's a concern for your setup.
